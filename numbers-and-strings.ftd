In the last exercise we created a boolean, we will now use numbers and strings
in FTD.

We have two types, {ds.highlight: `integer` and `decimal` for dealing with
numbers} in FTD. _Integers are signed_. `integer`s and `decimal`s are quite
similar to `boolean`s, we have the `-- integer foo: 10` syntax to define them.

{ds.highlight: Strings in FTD do not use quotes}, so a string is defined like
`-- string name: amitu`. Also you can define multi-line string like this:

-- ds.code: multi-line string in ftd
lang: ftd

\-- string about-this-workshop:

FTD language is a possible replacement for JavaScript/React to build
web front-ends. In this workshop you will learn the basics of FTD and
build a web app that talks to existing web services. We will build an
application for managing to-do lists from scratch.

Basic knowledge of HTTP API is needed, but no prior knowledge of
front-end is required.

The workshop is taught by the creators of FTD, and you will learn
about the motivation and design decisions that shaped FTD as well.

In this hands-on workshop we will go through a series of exercises in
stages and write code to get the application working. Participants are
required to have a decent computer, but there is no need to install any
software before hand (other than your favorite editor).
