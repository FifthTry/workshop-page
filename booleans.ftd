-- ds.markdown:

We created a simple hello world message [the last exercise](id: ws-hello-world).
We could have done this in HTML as well. Where we differ from HTML is, if you
wanted to add a variable or define data, you would have to switch to JavaScript.
But we can do everything in FTD itself.

Unlike JavaScript and Python and other dynamically typed languages, {ds.highlight:
FTD is statically typed language}. All variables in FTD have a type, which must be
specified when the variable is constructed.

-- ds.code: This is how a boolean variable is created
lang: ftd

\-- boolean foo: true

-- ds.markdown:

We have created a `boolean` variable named `foo`, with an initial value of
`true`. A boolean variable can have only two values, `true` or `false`, and it
must be initialised with a value.

-- ds.h1: Conditional UI

We can use the `if` condition on a node to conditionally show a UI node:

-- ds.code: We get the value of a variable using `$open` syntax
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.text: open is true
if: $open

-- ds.markdown:

Only if the variable `open` is true only then text "open is true" would be
visible.

-- ws.task: Task 1: Fix the `index.ftd` file
$status: $ws.what-are-task-completed
;;button: what-are-task-1-button:

We wanted to create a link in the [index.ftd](https://github.com/ftd-lang/ftd-workshop/blob/main/01-data/02-boolean/index.ftd) file, but for some
reason the link is not working, can you find the problem and fix it?

-- end: ws.task

-- ws.task: Task 2: Fix the `boolean.ftd`
$status: $ws.what-are-task-completed
;;button: what-are-task-2-button:

If you open `/boolean/` you will see an error. This is because we have not yet
defined a variable that we are trying to use. [boolean.ftd](https://github.com/ftd-lang/ftd-workshop/blob/main/01-data/02-boolean/boolean.ftd) is
buggy! View the `boolean.ftd` and follow the instructions there to create a new
variable.

-- end: ws.task

-- ds.h1: You Are Done

-- ds.markdown:

You have learnt how to define a boolean variable and use to control the UI.

{ds.highlight: Move to learning about [numbers and strings](/workshop/numbers-and-strings/)}
or back to [the workshop](id: ws-hello-world).
